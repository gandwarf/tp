## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. During execution, the command may interact with the `Model` to perform necessary operations (e.g. deleting a client). While this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, it often involves multiple method calls between the `Command` and `Model`.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated in a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Internally, `LogicManager` also handles logging and error tracking through the `LogsCenter` utility. This enables detailed logs for actions such as the input command string and any exceptions thrown during parsing or execution, providing transparency and easing debugging.

The `Logic` component is designed with extensibility in mind. To support a new command, developers simply need to:
- Implement a new subclass of `Command` (e.g., `SortCommand`)
- Create a matching parser (e.g., `SortCommandParser`) that implements the `Parser<T>` interface
- Add a corresponding `case` to the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` method

This modular design makes it straightforward to extend the system while maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.
) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Rank feature

#### Command Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/RankClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Rank` command component,
* holds a client `Comparator` that determines the sort order between any two clients using the `compare` method.
* each `Comparator` has a `COMPARATOR_WORD` `String` that is used to parse user input to create the suitable `Comparator`.
* each `Comparator` also depends on the `Client` which helps to gain access to the required parameters to compare with.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the rank mechanism behaves at each step.

* The user launches the application, and decides that they want to see `Alice` at the top of their client list.
* They would simply have to type `rank name` as the command input.

Here's the sequence diagram that shows the flow of the execution for the command `rank name`.

<puml src="diagrams/RankSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rank name` Command" />

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

_Team size: 5_

1. **Support multiple product preferences for each client**: The current client only has one product preference and its frequency. We plan to make every client has a list of product preferences with its corresponding frequency, to meet a more realistic scenario.

2. **New commands to work with product preference**: Once we have multiple product preferences for each client, we would also like to add a command `AddProductPreference` to add product preferences cumulatively for one client, and a command `DeleteProductPreference` to delete a certain product preference and its frequency for one client.

3. **New commands to add tags cumulatively**: For the same reason, now we can only edit tags through `edit` command, and if we want to add a new tag to a client without touching existing tags, we will also have to type out all the existing tags in the command, which is very inconvenient and unpractical. We can add new command `AddTag` to add new tags cumulatively to a client, and another new command `DeleteTag` to delete a certain existing tag for a client.

4. **Rank clients by product frequency of a certain product preference**: We want our `rank` command to be more useful, adding it's ability to rank in many ways, including rank clients based on the frequency of a certain product.
